# Continual Learning for Network Intrusion Detection Systems
Deep Generative Replay (DGR) \[1\] is a continual learning strategy originally proposed in application to image data. Here, it is modified and applied to network traffic data extracted from the popular CIC-IDS2018 dataset. The data is divided into separate tasks, with each task containing different kinds of network attacks. The goal is to sequentially learn these tasks and maintain high accuracy across all previous tasks, while only having direct access to training data from the current task.
